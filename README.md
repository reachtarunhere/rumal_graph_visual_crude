# rumal_graph_visual_crude
Initial code for graph visual using material design. 
As of now an actual output of a thug analysis is used as rare.json. 
The graph currently can 
- higlight exploit paths
- open only nodes related to exploit paths keeping rest closed to make graph less crowded.
- Supports drag and zoom.
- Has required js code which can act as end points for imple,enting zoom buttons.
- A single function where node rules can be added.

NOTE: As the name suggests this is crude in terms of readabilty of js. Once it is placed within the rumal frontend different commits for different parts of code and commenting will make it better.
